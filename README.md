+ Arial
+ Sans-Serif
+ PT Serif 
+ Logo & Heading letter-spacing will be approx 6px 
+ Navigation letter-spacing will be approx 4px
## Wireframes 
For my wireframes I was suggested to use **balsamiq** rather than to create a design on a notepad. 
The initial design want through various changes before i came to a final design with the prefered color contrast. 

+ I understand my design will go through some changes as i go along, the design was created to give me some design feature and also a rough collection of the webpage design. 

## Technology 
For my first project **HTML & CSS** I was able to use a wide range of programes to implement my design. _A list of the technology features and programes used are listed below, with methods of use._ 

+ **HTML** used to create the body structure and layout of the web page. The structure were design using the coding language used for HTML. 
+ **CSS** used to create the design feature and to make the web page colourful and eye cathching for the user. The CSS was used in conjuction with the HTML structure. 
+ **GITHUB** was used to create, host and deploy the web design on to the platform. The benefit of **github** was to create repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. Github was also a great way to share your design to mentors and other colleagues and tutors to help view your code and seek further input and support.
+ **GITPOD** Gitpod allows you to define your project's configuration in code so you can launch a prebuilt development environment with one click.(_Source Google_) Gitpod was used to code all my **HTML and CSS** coding. 
 Some useful feature and pathways to note for Gitpod are as follows _open pre-design of webpage(browser)_ "**python3 -m http.server**".
To save work **git add .**
To commit **git commit -m "Added GITPOD"** and to push your work to GITHUB repositories **git push**.
## Testing 
+ Lighthouse Test 
I tested via the Google Developer Lighthouse check. Below is a screenshot of my results.
