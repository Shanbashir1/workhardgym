# Work Hard Gym - Project 1
For my first project with Code Institue I have created a Website using HTML and CSS

Located in the heart of Watford, it offers a wide variety of new joining package deals. The website will try to attract online customers and get them to join the membership online. The website will then keep the data and in future mailshot it to customer using the stored data and alert them with new offers.

## Wireframes 
For my wireframes I was suggested to use **balsamiq** rather than to create a design on a notepad. 
The initial design want through various changes before i came to a final design with the prefered color contrast.

+ I understand my design will go through some changes as i go along, the design was created to give me some design feature and also a rough collection of the webpage design. 

## Technology 
For my first project **HTML & CSS** I was able to use a wide range of programes to implement my design. _A list of the technology features and programes used are listed below, with methods of use._ 

+ **HTML** used to create the body structure and layout of the web page. The structure were design using the coding language used for HTML. 
+ **CSS** used to create the design feature and to make the web page colourful and eye cathching for the user. The CSS was used in conjuction with the HTML structure. 
+ **GITHUB** was used to create, host and deploy the web design on to the platform. The benefit of **github** was to create repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. Github was also a great way to share your design to mentors and other colleagues and tutors to help view your code and seek further input and support.
+ **GITPOD** Gitpod allows you to define your project's configuration in code so you can launch a prebuilt development environment with one click.(_Source Google_) Gitpod was used to code all my **HTML and CSS** coding. 
 Some useful feature and pathways to note for Gitpod are as follows _open pre-design of webpage(browser)_ "**python3 -m http.server**".
To save work **git add .**
To commit **git commit -m "Added GITPOD"** and to push your work to GITHUB repositories **git push**.
