#### For my first project with Code Institue I have created a Website using the HTML and CSS programs.

## Introduction
The Work Hard Gym is a new gym which will be located in Watford, Hertfordshire, England. The gym will cater for both male and females and target the local and surronding community. Located in the heart of Watford, it will offer a wide variety of new joining package deals. The website will try to attract customers online and eventually get them to join the membership online (future feature). The website will store the data and in future mailshot it to customers and alert them with new offers. 
## User Stories

 ## Color Scheme
- ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) '#f03c15'
- ![#fff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fff/000000?text=+) '#fff'
- ![#3a3a3a](https://via.placeholder.com/15/#3a3a3a/000000?text=+) '#3a3a3a'

### Color text for the Webpage
+ #3a3a3a (black)
+ #fff (White)

## Font Display
The Font that we would use for the design would be a combination of the following 
+ Arial
+ Sans-Serif
+ PT Serif 
+ Logo & Heading letter-spacing will be approx 6px 
+ Navigation letter-spacing will be approx 4px

## Wireframes 
+ For my wireframes I was suggested to use **balsamiq** rather than to create a design on a paper. 
+ The initial design want through various changes before I came to a final design with the prefered color contrast. 
+ I understand my design will go through some changes as I go along, the design was created to give me some design feature and also a rough collection of the webpage design. 

## Technology 
For my first project **HTML & CSS** I was able to use a wide range of programes to implement my design. _A list of the technology features and programes used are listed below, with methods of use._ 

+ **HTML** used to create the body structure and layout of the web page. The structure was designed using the coding language used for HTML. 
+ **CSS** used to create the design and style feature to make the web page colourful and eye cathching for the user. The CSS was used in conjuction with the HTML structure. 
+ **GITHUB** was used to create, host and deploy the web design on to the platform. The benefit of **github** was to create repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. Github was also a great way to share your design to mentors and other colleagues and tutors to help view your code and seek further input and support.
+ **GITPOD** Gitpod allows you to define your project's configuration in code so you can launch a prebuilt development environment with one click.(_Source Google_) Gitpod was used to code all my **HTML and CSS** coding. 

## Testing 
+ **Lighthouse Test** 
I tested via the Google Developer Lighthouse check. Below is a screenshot of my results. 
<img src="/images/lighthouse.png" style=" height= 400px; width: 500px;"/>

+ **The W3C Markup Validation Service https://validator.w3.org**
The coding was checked via W3 validator, My check revealed I had no errors or warnings
<img src="/images/w3-validator.png" style=" height= 400px; width: 500px;"/>

+ **The W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw**
The CSS code was check via The W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/.
My check revealed I had no errors or warnings
<img src="/images/w3-jigsaw.png" style=" height= 400px; width: 500px;"/>

## Fixed Bugs
+ Spacing for HTML & CSS - after chekcing my coding for both HTML and CSS I realised I had unnecessary spacing. These were deleated and the structure made tidy for viewing. 
+ Media Screen Sizes - I realised that my media screen sizes were not displaying the correct layout for mobile devices. These were fixed and check via **Am I responsive app** and the **google developer tool**.

## Unfixed Bugs

 There was no unfixed bugs by the time this was written.

## Programs & Applications Used
+ **Balsamiq**
This was used to create the wireframes during the design phase of the project, initally my design was made on a notepad, until balsamiq was mentioned for use. 

+ **Google Fonts** - 
This app was used to select the LATO and PT Serif fonts, however mid way into the project i decided to use Arial and Sans Serif though out the project.
+ **Font Awesome**
Font Awesome was used to select icons to make the images relate to the headers. Font awesome added a attractive image to my page
+ **GitPod**
GitPod was used for writing code, commiting, and then pushing to GitHub.
+ **Github**
GitHub was used to save projects and commit changes after they had been pushed. 


+ **Am I Responsive**
This was used in order to see responsive design throughout the process and view different responsive designs. 

## Deployment
### GITHUB
To deploy pages to Github the following steps were taken. 
1. Login into your GITHUB account _if you do not have one, you will need to create one_
2. Find Repository button and open page
3. Locate the setting button and then locate the pages button. 
4. You will then need to click the source button, on the tab labelled "none" select "main"
5. Once "main" has been selected the page will start to deploy, this will take a few minutes to deploy.
6. Once the link turns green, your link will be deployed. 
### GITPOD
 + Some useful feature and pathways to note for Gitpod are as follows _open pre-design of webpage(browser)_ 
 "**python3 -m http.server**".
+ To save work **git add .**
+ To commit **git commit -m TYPE MESSAGE i.e "added image to front page"** 
+ push your work to GITHUB repositories **git push**.
