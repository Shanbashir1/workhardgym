For my first project with Code Institue I have created a Website using HTML and CSS

The Work Hard Gym is a new gym which has just launched in Watford, England. The gym caters for both male and females and targets the local and surronding community. Located in the heart of Watford, it offers a wide variety of new joining package deals. The website will try to attract online customers and get them to join the membership online. The website will then keep the data and in future mailshot it to customer using the stored data and alert them with new offers.

### Color text for the Webpage
+ #3a3a3a (black)
+ #fff 
(White)

## Font Display
The Font that we would use for the webpage will be a combination  of the following 
+ Arial
+ Sans-Serif
+ PT Serif 
+ Logo & Heading letter-spacing will be approx 6px 
+ Navigation letter-spacing will be approx 4px
## Wireframes 
For my wireframes I was suggested to use **balsamiq** rather than to create a design on a notepad. 
The initial design want through various changes before i came to a final design with the prefered color contrast. 

+ I understand my design will go through some changes as i go along, the design was created to give me some design feature and also a rough collection of the webpage design. 

## Technology 
For my first project **HTML & CSS** I was able to use a wide range of programes to implement my design. _A list of the technology features and programes used are listed below, with methods of use._ 

+ **HTML** used to create the body structure and layout of the web page. The structure were design using the coding language used for HTML. 
+ **CSS** used to create the design feature and to make the web page colourful and eye cathching for the user. The CSS was used in conjuction with the HTML structure. 
+ **GITHUB** was used to create, host and deploy the web design on to the platform. The benefit of **github** was to create repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. Github was also a great way to share your design to mentors and other colleagues and tutors to help view your code and seek further input and support.
+ **GITPOD** Gitpod allows you to define your project's configuration in code so you can launch a prebuilt development environment with one click.(_Source Google_) Gitpod was used to code all my **HTML and CSS** coding. 
 Some useful feature and pathways to note for Gitpod are as follows _open pre-design of webpage(browser)_ "**python3 -m http.server**".
To save work **git add .**
To commit **git commit -m "Added GITPOD"** and to push your work to GITHUB repositories **git push**.
## Testing 
+ **Lighthouse Test** 
I tested via the Google Developer Lighthouse check. Below is a screenshot of my results. 
<img src="/images/lighthouse.png" style=" height= 400px; width: 500px;"/>

+ **The W3C Markup Validation Service https://validator.w3.org**
The coding was checked via W3 validator, My check revealed I had no errors or warnings
<img src="/images/w3-validator.png" style=" height= 400px; width: 500px;"/>

+ **The W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw**
The CSS code was check via The W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/.
My check revealed I had no errors or warnings

## Fixed Bugs
+ Spacing for HTML & CSS - after chekcing my coding for both HTML and CSS I realised I had unnecessary spacing. These were deleated and the structure made tidy for viewing. 
+ Media Screen Sizes - I realised that my media screen sizes were not displaying the correct layout for mobile devices. These were fixed and check via **Am I responsive app** and the **google developer tool**.

## Unfixed Bugs

 There was no unfixed bugs by the time this was written.

## Programs & Applications Used
+ **Balsamiq**
This was used to create the wireframes during the design phase of the project, initally my design was made on a notepad, until balsamiq was mentioned for use. 

+ **Google Fonts** - 
This app was used to select the LATO and PT Serif fonts, however mid way into the project i decided to use Arial and Sans Serif though out the project.
+ **Font Awesome**
Font Awesome was used to select icons to make the images relate to the headers. Font awesome added a attractive image to my page
+ **GitPod**
GitPod was used for writing code, commiting, and then pushing to GitHub.
+ **Github**
GitHub was used to save projects and commit changes after they had been pushed. 


+ **Am I Responsive**
This was used in order to see responsive design throughout the process and view different responsive designs. 

## Deployment
To deploy pages to Github the following steps were taken. 
1. Login into your GITHUB account _if you do not have one, you will need to create one_
2. Find Repository button and open page
3. Locate the setting button and then locate the pages button. 
4. You will then need to click the source button, on the tab labelled "none" select "main"
5. Once "main" has been selected the page will start to deploy, this will take a few minutes to deploy.
6. Once the link turns green, your link will be deployed.
