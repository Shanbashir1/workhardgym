# Work Hard Gym - Project 1
For my first project with Code Institue I have created a Website using HTML and CSS
## Introduction
The Work Hard Gym is a new gym which has just launched in Watford, England. The gym caters for both male and females and targets the local and surronding community. Located in the heart of Watford, it offers a wide variety of new joining package deals. The website will try to attract online customers and get them to join the membership online. The website will then keep the data and in future mailshot it customer database with further offers.
